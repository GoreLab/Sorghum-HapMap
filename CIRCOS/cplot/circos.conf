# are usually chromosomes, but can be any integer axis.

<spacing>
# Spacing between ideograms. Suffix "r" denotes a relative value. It
# is relative to circle circumference (e.g. space is 0.5% of
# circumference).

# Ideogram position, thickness and fill. 
#
# Radial position within the image of the ideograms. This value is
# usually relative ("r" suffix).
radius           = 0.90r

# Thickness of ideograms, which can be absolute (e.g. pixels, "p"
# suffix) or relative ("r" suffix). When relative, it is a fraction of
# image radius.
thickness        = 20p

# Ideograms can be drawn as filled, outlined, or both. When filled,
# the color will be taken from the last field in the karyotype file,
# or set by chromosomes_colors. Color names are discussed in
#
# http://www.circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/configuration/configuration_files
#
# When stroke_thickness=0p or if the parameter is missing, the ideogram is
# has no outline and the value of stroke_color is not used.

fill             = yes  
stroke_color     = dgrey
