# Heat maps are used for data types which associate a value with a
# genomic position, or region. As such, this track uses the same data
# format as histograms.
#
# The track linearly maps a range of values [min,max] onto a list of colors c[n], i=0..N.
#
# f = (value - min) / ( max - min )
# n = N * f

# hue000,hue120,hue140).
