This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 



```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}


header <- read.delim(file = "/home/roberto/Sorghum/WGS/VCF_2.0/PCA/duplicates/DUPS.dist.id", stringsAsFactors = F, header = F) 

table <- read.delim(file = "/home/roberto/Sorghum/WGS/VCF_2.0/PCA/duplicates/DUPS.dist", stringsAsFactors = F, header = F) %>%
  `colnames<-`(header[,1]) %>%
  `rownames<-`(header[,1])

tabla <- as.matrix(table) 

heatmap(tabla)

```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
